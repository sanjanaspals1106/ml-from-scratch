# ML From Scratch

Core Machine Learning algorithms implemented **entirely from scratch** using NumPy,
with a strong focus on **intuition, geometry, and training dynamics** rather than
library abstractions.

This repository treats machine learning as a process of:
**derivation → implementation → optimization → evaluation**.

No high-level ML libraries are used.

## Structure & Progress

### Book 1 — Linear Regression (Geometry of Prediction)
- Linear model intuition: y = Xw + b
- Predictions as projections
- Residuals as geometric distances
- Underfitting vs good fit
- ML view: fitting a line/plane to data

---

## Book 2 — Linear Regression (Learning via Optimization)
- Loss function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Error as a function of parameters
- Loss surface and convexity
- Gradient as direction of steepest increase
- Gradient descent as iterative learning
- Learning rate and convergence
- ML view: learning parameters by minimizing error
